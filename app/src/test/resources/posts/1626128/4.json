Shuts down 3rd party apps. The majority of people have to decided whether to stay or leave. \n\nThe SAG and WGA go on strike because of wage issues, now shows like Last Week Tonight and other shows that take deep dives into the problems of government can't make shows that inform people. \n\nAll of this is, in my opinion, to shut down public conversations about many issues and the timing is also coincidental since the 2024 election is coming up and in a time everyone is divided, there is no comfortable place to communicate. The curiosity is if trumps social media and other right leaning communities are facing the same disruptions. Not saying reddit and twitter are bastions of the \"left\" but twitter and in particular  reddit have been a place for public good. Now twitter is a hallway that is almost completely covered in fecal matter and reddit is a poorly designed website that blinds you with advertisements and OF spam bots. \n\nElon I can see doing it maliciously, because he benefits from a Republican government. Edge Lord Jr has probably doing it because Senior told him it was a good idea. The survivability of these companies are not in their interest because why care if you can just close it down claim the sale and go make more money somewhere else. \n\nBut the biggest one is the \"Late Night\" shows. Most of them are the way some Americans get informed about some of the more deeply rooted problems in America. You can look at shows like John Olivers, Last Week Tonight and maybe Late Night with Seth Meyers. Shows very critical of Republicans and trump in particular, completely crippled by the SAG and WGA strikes. \n\nIn total the information delivery systems we are all used too, have been dirupted and I'm seriously questioned its timing.
