Like the old days but supercharged with new tech.","removed":false,"published":"2023-07-17T14:45:30","deleted":false,"ap_id":"https://kbin.social/m/reddit@lemmy.world/t/210347/-/comment/878686","local":false,"path":"0.1377037.1377395.1377627.1380558","distinguished":false,"language_id":0},"creator":{"id":43395,"name":"MeowdyPardner","display_name":"MeowdyPardner","avatar":"https://media.kbin.social/media/d0/85/d085deea8bf1a7f3ec648c1ccb2e758671dad90c715e4643147fb5b2e40e3215.jpg","banned":false,"published":"2023-06-09T04:36:19","actor_id":"https://kbin.social/u/MeowdyPardner","local":false,"deleted":false,"admin":false,"bot_account":false,"instance_id":257},"post":{"id":1626128,"name":"Reddit now won't let non-logged in users see subreddits until they've been \"reviewed\"","url":"https://lemmy.world/pictrs/image/a7f6b474-4e78-48d4-88b1-72fa79e82d3e.png","body":"This is literally just the r/nyt subreddit about The New York Times.\n\nGiven he apparently takes inspiration from Elon Musk, it's only a matter of time until u/spez starts adding post view limits unless you pay extra.","creator_id":870725,"community_id":4157,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-07-17T12:48:24.377998","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"thumbnail_url":"https://lemmy.world/pictrs/image/45a0acbf-fdc4-440f-a825-aada8cccff86.png","ap_id":"https://lemmy.world/post/1626128","local":true,"language_id":0,"featured_community":false,"featured_local":false},"community":{"id":4157,"name":"reddit","title":"Reddit","description":"News and Discussions about Reddit \n-\n\nWelcome to !reddit.
