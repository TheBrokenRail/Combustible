I moderated a larger subreddit and I can tell you that the stats for old.reddit are tiny compared to the rest so it's not worth the cost of implementing. Further if you use old.reddit you probably already have a dislike for the app and will rather abandon the content then install the app. Finally old.reddit is used more by old-school redditors which tend to be the vocal minority that will complain about the change the loudest.

There was/is a discussion about how the right wing is suing and chilling any and all efforts to expose and educate about disinformation.  The lawsuits were so menacing that they even wanted to go after the students of the classes run by professors they were suing for teaching about present day disinformation in our society. It isn't just professors, it includes writers and journalists and groups that targeted disinformation. This is being done under the banner of 'bias'.  Opposing, criticizing, or pushing back against far right wing messaging is attacked and sued as intolerable bias.\n\nIt's believed that this is to clear the way for a massive onslaught of disinformation and conspiracy theories entering into the 2024 election cycle.  As far as what's happening to some social media sites, the timing is suspect.  Reddit and Twitter were among the most effective at getting out the blue vote. Now they are in shambles.","removed":false,"published":"2023-07-17T19:05:01.147411","deleted":false,"ap_id":"https://lemmy.world/comment/1390819","local":true,"path":"0.1385471.1390819","distinguished":false,"language_id":0},"creator":{"id":910448,"name":"ghostBones","banned":false,"published":"2023-07-10T07:17:34.431592","actor_id":"https://lemmy.world/u/ghostBones","local":true,"deleted":false,"admin":false,"bot_account":false,"instance_id":1},"post":{"id":1626128,"name":"Reddit now won't let non-logged in users see subreddits until they've been \"reviewed\"","url":"https://lemmy.world/pictrs/image/a7f6b474-4e78-48d4-88b1-72fa79e82d3e.png","body":"This is literally just the r/nyt subreddit about The New York Times.\n\nGiven he apparently takes inspiration from Elon Musk, it's only a matter of time until u/spez starts adding post view limits unless you pay extra.","creator_id":870725,"community_id":4157,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-07-17T12:48:24.377998","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"thumbnail_url":"https://lemmy.world/pictrs/image/45a0acbf-fdc4-440f-a825-aada8cccff86.png","ap_id":"https://lemmy.world/post/1626128","local":true,"language_id":0,"featured_community":false,"featured_local":false},"community":{"id":4157,"name":"reddit","title":"Reddit","description":"News and Discussions about Reddit \n-\n\nWelcome to !reddit.
