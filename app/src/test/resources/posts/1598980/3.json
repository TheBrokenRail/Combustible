Finally he gave in when he realized he had a lot more to lose than a few billion, or maybe he got a call from daddy who told him to stop being a moron and arrange a loan.","removed":false,"published":"2023-07-17T18:31:50.300568","updated":"2023-07-17T18:37:58.920096","deleted":false,"ap_id":"https://lemmy.world/comment/1389714","local":true,"path":"0.1355304.1357369.1357611.1358159.1360080.1377266.1387960.1389714","distinguished":false,"language_id":37},"creator":{"id":489840,"name":"MelonTheMan","avatar":"https://lemmy.world/pictrs/image/68985860-4790-4198-b3a1-4dad84b771ae.png","banned":false,"published":"2023-06-28T00:53:27.934581","actor_id":"https://lemmy.world/u/MelonTheMan","local":true,"banner":"https://lemmy.world/pictrs/image/b7ce75a7-5bfb-46c4-86eb-5d3cf4017a26.jpeg","deleted":false,"admin":false,"bot_account":false,"instance_id":1},"post":{"id":1598980,"name":"Twitter now blocking all DMs from non-Twitter Blue subscribers by default","url":"https://mashable.com/article/twitter-new-dm-option-verified-only-promotes-twitter-blue-change-it?","creator_id":39387,"community_id":2478,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-07-16T22:08:19.344436","updated":"2023-07-16T22:08:56.212656","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"embed_title":"Twitter changed DM settings so users who don't pay for Twitter Blue can't message you","embed_description":"Elon Musk just turned your DMs into an ad for Twitter Blue.
