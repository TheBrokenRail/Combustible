This is because of the codecs and plugins Firefox uses instead.\n\nFirefox on Android is very clunky. Pull to refresh was in the beta for years, and they *finally* just released it into the main branch and it's bugged to shit. It was a meme how long it was in development and still doesn't work right, despite every other browser and app having pull to refresh work perfectly.\n\nI want to be clear, I exclusively use Firefox and think chromium is dangerous for the web. I'm just not going to lie and act like firefox is perfect. If it was, it would have larger marketshare. There's a reason Chrome, despite being a privacy nightmare, is still at the top. There's a reason nearly every browser is chromium based.\n\nI think being open about the shortcomings and experience you have with software is healthy. Good for development and good for making new users switch. Being critical is a good thing!","removed":false,"published":"2023-07-17T04:43:38.020742","deleted":false,"ap_id":"https://lemmy.ml/comment/1654609","local":false,"path":"0.1362660.1363214.1363659.1363787","distinguished":false,"language_id":37},"creator":{"id":3428,"name":"JshKlsn","avatar":"https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/01a164b1-c58b-4f87-9029-caafd296aecc.png","banned":false,"published":"2023-06-04T18:13:39.923290","actor_id":"https://lemmy.ml/u/JshKlsn","bio":"Just trying to create communities on Lemmy.ml to help with the big migration.","local":false,"deleted":false,"admin":false,"bot_account":false,"instance_id":3},"post":{"id":1611939,"name":"If you value privacy, ditch Chrome and switch to Firefox now","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/90560574/ditch-chrome-for-firefoxs-better-privacy","body":"With the number of people concerned about privacy, it is a wonder why chrome is even popular.","creator_id":628923,"community_id":2478,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-07-17T03:43:57.067737","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"ap_id":"https://lemmy.world/post/1611939","local":true,"language_id":37,"featured_community":false,"featured_local":false},"community":{"id":2478,"name":"technology","title":"Technology","description":"Its a new technology community.

It's people who discovered internet after 2000, who think Firefox doesn't have enough features, and is \"being unreasonable\", because essentially *every. single. browser* is now chrome or chromium, with the exception of Firefox (and safari?); and because of companies like adobe blaming Firefox for \"not playing nice with others\" simply because it isn't chrome/chromium...\n\nEdit: to those who downvoted, which I can only assume is because of my comment on bugs, please install NetBSD 9.3, ctwm, set pkgin up against 2023Q1, and install Firefox 110.0.1 with noscript, umatrix and ublock origin. Now witness how *all* your menus disappear immediatey as you `mouseover` upon them. Now please explain to me how this isn't a bug...\n\nEdit 2: instead of attempting to \"backseat debug\" without any information on the actual problem, or even without trying to reproduce the bug (I gave **all** the info I would start with), please accept that Firefox *can* have bugs, and that people online *can* know what they are talking about.

I wouldn't describe Firefox as buggy or clunky. On the whole, I find Firefox more pleasant to use than Chrome on its own merits—nothing at all to do with privacy or Google.\n\nI do agree that Chrome is more performant on JS-heavy websites, but not so much so that I find Firefox sluggish by comparison. And both slow down significantly once you have lots of tabs open.\n\nI prefer Firefox's tab UI to Chrome's, both on desktop and mobile:\n- Firefox on desktop will scroll the tab bar horizontally once you have enough tabs open, meaning you can still see the title of each. Chrome will keep on shrinking your tabs until each is just an icon, making it really hard to tell between different pages on the same site.\n- The \"tab groups\" feature of Chrome on Android confuses me and isn't intuitive at all IMO. Firefox just has a traditional list of tabs, which I find much easier to use.\n\nI also love Firefox's screenshot tool. It's so much nicer than taking a screenshot via the OS:\n- It lets you screenshot an entire page even if it's too tall for the screen.\n- It lets you select specific elements on the page precisely.\n- If you invoke it through the developer console, you can take high-DPI screenshots even if you're using a low-DPI monitor. It'll re-render the page for you behind the scenes.\n\nFirefox also has way better (read: any at all) hardware video decoding support on desktop Linux than Chrome does. Some distros patch Chrome to add that support, but Firefox has it in official builds out of the box.\n\nI started using Firefox on Android because my old phone (Nexus 5X) was very RAM-constrained and Firefox seemed to kick fewer other apps out of RAM than Chrome did. I now have a newer phone where RAM isn't an issue, but I still use Firefox, mainly for uBlock and because it can sync tabs, bookmarks, and history to Firefox on my desktop. It runs just as smoothly as Chrome does in my experience.\n\nThis is all my personal experience, though. I have experienced frustrating Firefox bugs in the past that make it crash or freeze, and it sounds like GP is currently experiencing one such bug. But I've used Firefox for over a decade and probably only encountered 3-4 such bugs. Each time, once I got frustrated enough to go digging, I found an existing upstream bug report describing the root cause and a workaround to use until a proper fix landed (usually within a couple releases). I've used Chrome a lot less regularly, so I don't know if the experience there is comparable or if they do just have better QA for bugs like that. Either way, I think the benefits of Firefox for me outweigh the occasional bug that gets through for a few releases.","removed":false,"published":"2023-07-17T05:28:48.990938","updated":"2023-07-17T05:32:44.761377","deleted":false,"ap_id":"https://lemm.ee/comment/1208091","local":false,"path":"0.1362660.1363214.1363416.1364661","distinguished":false,"language_id":37},"creator":{"id":1107070,"name":"tchebb","avatar":"https://lemm.ee/pictrs/image/11c6d0da-07c5-43b6-96cc-e3f83703c423.webp","banned":false,"published":"2023-07-16T19:49:46.076313","actor_id":"https://lemm.ee/u/tchebb","local":false,"deleted":false,"matrix_user_id":"@tchebb:matrix.org","admin":false,"bot_account":false,"instance_id":626},"post":{"id":1611939,"name":"If you value privacy, ditch Chrome and switch to Firefox now","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/90560574/ditch-chrome-for-firefoxs-better-privacy","body":"With the number of people concerned about privacy, it is a wonder why chrome is even popular.","creator_id":628923,"community_id":2478,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-07-17T03:43:57.067737","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"ap_id":"https://lemmy.world/post/1611939","local":true,"language_id":37,"featured_community":false,"featured_local":false},"community":{"id":2478,"name":"technology","title":"Technology","description":"Its a new technology community.

Its not recommended to run standalone, although it will. Best bet of you want a Chromium-based browser is to find a forked version of it. Brave is one that comes to find, as its geared to be better for privacy.\n\nFirefox is also a solid, secure browser. It is backed by Mozilla, which has been a champion of the open source community for years. It's going to have a different approach to the web since its not backed by an advertising company.
