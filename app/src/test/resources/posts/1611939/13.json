Opera GX and Vivaldi are outliers only because of how dramatic the differences are for me.","removed":false,"published":"2023-07-17T12:27:42.445861","updated":"2023-07-17T12:33:12.856364","deleted":false,"ap_id":"https://lemmy.blahaj.zone/comment/1119245","local":false,"path":"0.1364915.1366957.1367340.1369458.1375918","distinguished":false,"language_id":37},"creator":{"id":156323,"name":"skylestia","display_name":"skye","avatar":"https://lemmy.blahaj.zone/pictrs/image/uRBK4aaFpX.jpg","banned":false,"published":"2023-06-15T23:23:39.170364","actor_id":"https://lemmy.blahaj.zone/u/skylestia","bio":"im am skye (she/her or they/them)\n\ni'm a hobbyist who writes, makes videos, does web development stuff, and has recently started trying to do art. i also like to play vibeo games sometimes and i use social media mostly to find memes","local":false,"banner":"https://lemmy.blahaj.zone/pictrs/image/sBLIuxj7hi.png","deleted":false,"admin":false,"bot_account":false,"instance_id":234},"post":{"id":1611939,"name":"If you value privacy, ditch Chrome and switch to Firefox now","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/90560574/ditch-chrome-for-firefoxs-better-privacy","body":"With the number of people concerned about privacy, it is a wonder why chrome is even popular.","creator_id":628923,"community_id":2478,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-07-17T03:43:57.067737","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"ap_id":"https://lemmy.world/post/1611939","local":true,"language_id":37,"featured_community":false,"featured_local":false},"community":{"id":2478,"name":"technology","title":"Technology","description":"Its a new technology community.
