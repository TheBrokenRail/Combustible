Who cares if your browser tracks your online presence when everything is connected back to your facebook profile or whatever is trending.\n\nMost individuals embrace convenience above all; literally putting all their private stuff on any online service that tout \"shiny feature that you won't even use\". Even some privacy-focused people don't see putting all your emails/photo/video/agenda/chat/text messages in one third party opaque service as an issue.\n\nTons of business do the same, outsourcing the most basic stuff like private discussions and storage to anything \"convenient\" to not pay for two sysadmin to manage it (leading to most major leaks). I have direct experience of business coming to us, asking \"yeah, privacy is good, data ownership and control is mandatory, so we won't host anything and you'll keep all our data, deal?\". They prefer have us, a third party, bill them for hosting rather than have some control over it.\n\nMy take on this is that while pointing that browsers can be an issue is not a bad thing, the first step would be to get people and business interested in their privacy. Without that, it remains a niche.
