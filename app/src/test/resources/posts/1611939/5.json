They've spent most of it on firefox devs salaries and moved 13ish million to mozilla foundation, the NPO. The Mozilla Foundation itself earned somewhere around 13 mil, too, with about a mil coming from direct donations, rest from grants. They've spent it on evangelistic purposes, like on events in fuck knows where, stuff not directly related to firefox(vpn, vr stuff), grants to other projects (like rust), but mostly into managements pockets. None of that goes to firefox the browser. \n\nAs you can see, Mozilla is completely at a mercy of Google, especially after the deal with yandex fell through due to sactions. Otherwise, they don't have nearly enough resources to keep up as is, nevermind losing 95% of revenue. There is a glimmer of hope for them pivoting into mozilla ecosystem, like with VPN and password manager, but I havent heard about those in a while, and the competetion is stiff there, but Im keeping my hopes up.

It's just that they don't always *know* they care, or *to what extent*. The big problem is that there's virtually no way to visualize the harm in using privacy-invading products and services. Everything that goes on in the background of our phones, we'd never tolerate in real life.\n\nIf you could visually *see* every time there's a background process, an app activating the mic, the sensors, the location, accessing your messages, etc., we'd be in a better position.\n\nThere's no way we'd tolerate the IRL equivalents of what goes on digitally—at the browser level, at the app level, perhaps even at the OS level.\n\nIt's usually visual cues that set off change. Think about it this way: 9/11 killed ~3000 people and we got the USA PATRIOT Act virtually overnight. COVID-19 happened and killed ~1.1 million people in the US alone. But because COVID wasn't as \"visual\" and as \"graphic\" as 9/11, there was less urgency to do something about it.","removed":false,"published":"2023-07-17T20:43:43.002671","deleted":false,"ap_id":"https://lemmy.world/comment/1394406","local":true,"path":"0.1383624.1394406","distinguished":false,"language_id":37},"creator":{"id":858081,"name":"rageagainstmachines","banned":false,"published":"2023-07-08T17:02:25.596629","actor_id":"https://lemmy.world/u/rageagainstmachines","local":true,"deleted":false,"admin":false,"bot_account":false,"instance_id":1},"post":{"id":1611939,"name":"If you value privacy, ditch Chrome and switch to Firefox now","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/90560574/ditch-chrome-for-firefoxs-better-privacy","body":"With the number of people concerned about privacy, it is a wonder why chrome is even popular.","creator_id":628923,"community_id":2478,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-07-17T03:43:57.067737","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"ap_id":"https://lemmy.world/post/1611939","local":true,"language_id":37,"featured_community":false,"featured_local":false},"community":{"id":2478,"name":"technology","title":"Technology","description":"Its a new technology community.
